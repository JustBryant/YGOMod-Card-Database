If this card would be destroyed by battle or an opponent's card effect, you can send 1 other card you control to the GY instead. You can send 1 Level 3 monster from your Deck to the GY, then target 1 \"Burning Abyss\" monster on the field; it gains ATK/DEF equal to the ATK/DEF of the monster sent to the GY, until the end of this turn. You can only use this effect of \"Cherubini, Ebon Angel of the Burning Abyss\" once per turn.",

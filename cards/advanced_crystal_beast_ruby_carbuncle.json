If this face-up card is destroyed in a Monster Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY. While this card is treated as a Continuous Spell: You can Special Summon this card, then you can Special Summon as many \"Advanced Crystal Beast\" Monster Cards as possible from your Spell & Trap Zones. You can only use this effect of \"Advanced Crystal Beast Ruby Carbuncle\" once per turn.",

  "description": "While this card is in your GY, if a \"Salamangreat\" Link Monster you control leaves the field because of an opponent's card effect (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon 2 Level 4 \"Salamangreat\" monsters from your GY, including this card, but negate their effects, and if you do, immediately after this effect resolves, Xyz Summon 1 \"Salamangreat\" Xyz Monster, using only those 2 monsters. You can only use this effect of \"Salamangreat Zebroid X\" once per turn. An Xyz Monster that was Summoned using this card on the field as material gains this effect.\r\n● This card gains 300 ATK for each material attached to it.",

  "description": "While you control a \"Memento\" monster, your opponent's monsters that can attack must attack the \"Memento\" monster you control with the highest ATK (their choice, if tied). When your opponent activates a monster effect on the field (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 \"Mementoal Tecuhtlica - Combined Creation\" you control; it loses exactly 1000 ATK/DEF, and if it does, negate that activated effect. You can only activate this effect of \"Mementotlan Cranium Burst\" once per Chain.",

  "description": "You cannot Xyz Summon monsters with the same name as a card you control. You can target 2 \"Ryzeal\" cards in your GY, except \"Ryzeal Cross\"; place them on the bottom of the Deck in any order, then draw 1 card. You can only use this effect of \"Ryzeal Cross\" once per turn. Once per turn, when a monster effect activated by your opponent resolves, you can detach 1 material from a \"Ryzeal\" Xyz Monster you control, and if you do, negate that effect.",

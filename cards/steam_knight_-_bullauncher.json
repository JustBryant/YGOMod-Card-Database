  "description": "''\"BULLauncher\" is a support machine specializing in bombardment and daytime combat that not only has the constantly refined \"Coc-OS\" and \"BFS Armor\", but it also has 3 \"Foil-Packers\" installed within it under orders of \"Madera\" after repeated trial and error. By installing a \"Beef-Rifle\" or other armaments, it can be used as medium- and long-range support for the \"Steam Knights\" and their operations. Also, \"BULLauncher\" can be combined with \"WINGear\", which specializes in high-speed aerial combat, and \"BOARms\", which specializes in melee and assault combat, to cause the high-calorie \"Steam Jushin - BW\" to descend upon this world.''",

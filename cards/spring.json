Monsters you control gain 400 ATK for each Season Counter on this card. Once per turn, during your opponent's End Phase: You can take 1 Field Spell from your Deck that you can place a Season Counter on, and place it face-up on your field (but neither player can activate its effects this turn), and if you do, place all Season Counters on this card on that card.",

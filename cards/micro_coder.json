If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY as material for the Link Summon of a \"Code Talker\" monster: You can either add 1 \"Cynet\" Spell/Trap from your Deck to your hand, or, if this card on the field was used as material, you can add 1 Level 4 Cyberse monster instead. You can only use each effect of \"Micro Coder\" once per turn.",

  "description": "If a face-up \"Crystal Beast\" monster you control would be destroyed, you can place a Crystallization Counter on it instead. Monsters with Crystallization Counters are considered Continuous Spell Cards in your Spell & Trap Zone instead of monsters. If a card with a Crystallization Counter would be Special Summoned, remove the counter. Cards with Crystallization Counters can be used as Fusion Material for \"Ultimate Crystal\" monsters.",

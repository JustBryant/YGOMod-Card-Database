If you Synchro Summon a monster that mentions a \"Synchron\" Tuner as material, this card in your hand can also be used as material. If a monster(s) you control (that mentions \"Junk Warrior\" or is a Synchro Monster with \"Warrior\" in its original name) would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this card from your field or GY instead.",

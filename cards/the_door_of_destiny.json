(This card is also still a Trap Card.) During your Standby Phase, while this card is treated as a monster: You can banish any number of \"Utopia\" monsters with different names from your Graveyard; inflict 500 damage to your opponent for each of those banished monsters, and if you do, this card gains ATK equal to the damage they took.",

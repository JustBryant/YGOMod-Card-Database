The scale of the Tempura here is not only large but also so beautifully shaped that it has earned the nickname of \"Golden Tempura\". The state-of-the-art facilities and the atmosphere of other cultures are all in the harbor, but there is also a mellow, nostalgic aroma in the air, and the occasional crackle of the crackling sounds will lift your spirits. We have been looking forward to this cruise for a year, but I think 3 stars is just about right.''",

You can send this card from your hand or field to the GY; add 1 \"Advanced Dark\" from your Deck to your hand. Once per turn: You can target 1 \"Advanced Crystal Beast\" card you control; return it to the hand or place it on top of the Deck. If this face-up card is destroyed in a Monster Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.",

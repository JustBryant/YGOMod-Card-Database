During the Main Phase: You can send this face-up card to the GY; place 1 of your \"Dream Mirror of Joy\" or \"Dream Mirror of Terror\" that is banished or in your GY, face-up in your Field Zone, then you can Special Summon 1 monster from your hand that specifically lists that card you placed in its text.",

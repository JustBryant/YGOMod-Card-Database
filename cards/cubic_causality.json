  "description": "Distribute a number of Cubic Counters on face-up monsters your opponent controls, up to the number of \"Cubic\" monsters you control. (Monsters with a Cubic Counter cannot attack, also negate their effects.) You can banish this card from your GY, then target 1 \"Cubic\" monster you control; this turn, each time it destroys a monster by battle that has a Cubic Counter, inflict damage to your opponent equal to the original ATK of that destroyed monster. You can only use each effect of \"Cubic Causality\" once per turn.",

Your \"Advanced Crystal Beast\" monsters can attack directly, but when they do so using this effect, the battle damage inflicted to your opponent is halved. If this face-up card is destroyed in a Monster Zone, you can place it face-up in your Spell & Trap Zone as a Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.",

If this card is sent from the hand or field to the GY as material for the Link Summon of a \"Code Talker\" monster: You can target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; change its ATK 0, also negate its effects. If this card on the field was used as material, you can target 2 monsters, instead. You can only use each effect of \"Code Radiator\" once per turn.",

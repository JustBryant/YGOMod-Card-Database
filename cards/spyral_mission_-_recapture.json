  "description": "Destroy this card during your 3rd End Phase after activation. Once per turn, if a \"SPYRAL\" monster is Special Summoned to your field (except during the Damage Step): You can target 1 monster your opponent controls; take control of it until the End Phase, but it cannot attack directly this turn. If a \"SPYRAL\" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can banish this card from your Graveyard instead of destroying 1 of those \"SPYRAL\" monsters.",

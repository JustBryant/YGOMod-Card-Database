You can send 1 monster from your hand or field to the GY, then target 1 \"Elvennotes\" monster in your GY with a different original Attribute; Special Summon it, then if you control a Synchro Monster, you can negate the effects of 1 face-up card your opponent controls until the end of this turn. You can only use this effect of \"Elvennotes ~Maddening Rhapsodia~\" once per turn.",
